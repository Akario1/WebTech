                <p>Nyan Cat is a YouTube video uploaded in April 2011,
                which became an Internet meme. The video merged a Japanese pop song 
                with an animated cartoon cat with a Pop-Tart for a torso flying through space and 
                leaving a rainbow trail behind. The video ranked at number 
                five on the list of most viewed YouTube videos in 2011.</p>

                    On April 2, 2011, the GIF animation of the cat was posted by 25-year-old 
                    Christopher Torres of Dallas, Texas, who uses the name "prguitarman", 
                    on his website LOL-Comics. Torres explained in an interview where the 
                    idea for the animation came from: "I was doing a donation drive for the Red Cross 
                    and in-between drawings in my Livestream video chat, two different people mentioned 
                    I should draw a 'Pop Tart' and a 'cat'." In response, he created a hybrid image of a 
                    Pop-Tart and a cat, which was developed a few days later into the animated GIF. 
                    Nyan Cat was based on a real cat: Torres' pet cat Marty, who died in November 2012 from 
                    feline infectious peritonitis.
